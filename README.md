# Personal Finance Manager

Personal Finance Manager is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users manage their personal finances. The application provides features for tracking debtors, creditors, and other personal transactions. Users can add other individuals who owe them money as debtors, and these debtors can initiate payments to settle their debts. All payments must be verified and approved by the creditor. The application makes it significantly easier to track finances, especially between parties and individuals.

## Features

- Track debtors and creditors: Add individuals who owe you money as debtors and keep track of the amounts they owe.
- Initiate payments: Debtors can initiate payments to settle their debts.
- Verify and approve payments: Creditors can verify and approve payments made by debtors.
- Manage personal transactions: Keep track of your personal financial transactions.
- User authentication: Secure user authentication and registration.

## Note: This project was built at a 24-hour hackathon and is still under construction.
